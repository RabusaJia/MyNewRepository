	<center><br />From the dark black ball, I see,

<br />Knives were like looking at me.
<br />Sweet word from his mouth flattered me,

<br />Yet, doubtful as it can be.

<br />Angel, he looks when in front of you,

<br />Demo when behind laughing at you.

<br />A friend youâ€™ve thought to trust,

<br />But an enemy you never want.

<br />Like a snake from the wild,

<br />Keeps gossiping behind.

<br />Like predator that hunts its prey,

<br />It never stops until it ends its day.

<br />His words may be dear,

<br />But actions are more clear.

<br />Be careful with your friends,

<br />You might be stabbed at the back at the end.
